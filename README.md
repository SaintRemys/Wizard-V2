this project is a recreation of the roblox UI library Wizard, since the code was obfuscated, outdated, abandoned and lacking important functions, I have decided to recreate it from scratch, with all the same gui scaling, behaviour, everything just with some small QOL and functionality improvements, I will soon be making a discord.
